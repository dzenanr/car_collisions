    <h1>Car Collisions</h1>

    <p>
      A game with moving cars of different colors,
      whose objective is to move the red car,
      by moving your mouse, with few collisions.
      <br/>
      If the red car is hit, it changes the color and size.
      As a penalty, a new car appears.
      In order to revive the red car, click on the board.
